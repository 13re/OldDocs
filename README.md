# Makeroid Documentation

We understand that creating your app can sometimes be a struggle. You may not know how a component works, or don't know what a certain block does? Don't worry! We've put together some very detailed and helpful docs to help you understand.

There are a few different block types for each component. These are **Events**, **Methods **and **Properties**. To read more about each of these for each component, hover over them.

Properties in _italics_ are Designer Only properties, which means they cannot be changed using blocks.
